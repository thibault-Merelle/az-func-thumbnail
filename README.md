this project is part of my course at simplon school

### Microsoft Cloud Developer

### Goal:

You have just created the CopyGram application, a social network for sharing photos. Your app is working fine and users upload a lot of photos, which unfortunately makes the app slower and slower. Because each time you open the application loads all the photos that are visible on the page in high quality.

So you have a brilliant idea! Reduce the size of the images when they are not displayed in large on the application. When the user opens the application he will see thumbnail versions of the photos, and the "normal" version will not be loaded until he clicks on it to display it large.
